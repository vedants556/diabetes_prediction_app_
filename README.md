This project is a web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user-input health metrics. It utilizes multiple machine learning models to provide predictions and offers an informative interface for users to understand diabetes-related terms and normal ranges.

## 🌟 Features

- Prediction using multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Naive Bayes
  - AdaBoost
  - XGBoost
  - Extra Trees
- User-friendly web interface for inputting health metrics
- Informative table displaying diabetes-related terms and normal ranges
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Joblib (for loading machine learning models)
- NumPy

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone  https://github.com/vedants556/diabetes_prediction_app
   cd diabetes-prediction-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure all model files (*.joblib) are in the project root directory.

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## 📊 How It Works

1. Users input their health metrics through the web form.
2. The selected machine learning model processes the input data.
3. The application displays the prediction result.
4. Users can refer to the information table for understanding diabetes-related terms and normal ranges.
